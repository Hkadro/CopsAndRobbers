# CopsAndRobbers
Made for A Graph Theory Class

With this Project I wanted to test what would happen playing cops and robbers on a closed and open Graph. The closed Graph is robber-win and the open Graph is cop-win however this does not affect the random run throughs that much. Pull up a friend and play the game on the non-random Graphs together. All the programs are coded in Python utilizing the matplotlib and networkx library.
